# Week 4
## Partial Derivatives and Differentiability 
1. Introduction: 
   - Multivariate case: Extrapolate the differentiability from straight line to hyperplane 
2. **Tangent Plane** (*tangent line -> tanget plane*)
   - Definition: **tangent plane** can be defined as a limit of all secant planes. 
3. **Partial Derivatives: Definition**
   - f(x,y) in (a,b). Assume cross section by plane y = b. f(x,y) turns into the curve f(x,b). The tangent plan turns line.  
   - The slope is called **partial** 
   - pf/px = lim x->a (f(x,b) - f(a,b))/(x - a) = (f(x,b))'x|x = a
4. **Partial Derivatives: Examples**
   - schema: 
     - substitute y = b -> find a derivative at x = a or 
     - substitute y = b -> find a derivative at every point -> substitude x = a 
5. **Tangent Plane: Definition**
   - z = f(a,b) + f'x*(x - a) + f'y*(y-b) 
6. **Differentiability of Multivariate Function**
  - *to be differentiable* = to be *"fitted"* with plane object 
  - f(x, y) is called differentiable at point (a, b) if it is close to its tangent plane 
    - f(x,y) = f(a,b) + f'x*(x - a) + f'y*(y - b) + R(x, y)
    - R(x,y) = o((x-a)^2 + (y - n)^2
