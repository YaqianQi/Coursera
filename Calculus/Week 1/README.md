# Introduction 
1. **Main topic** 
   - basic terms: numerical set , mapping and function 
   - function graph, how to get one through transitions of know graph 
   - how to properly define sequence and its limit 
2. **Numerical Set** 
   - **Numerical Set**: Various process as functions of several variables 
   - **Set**: Entity, collection of some object. 
     - object can belongs to one set or not; one object could be included in the set only one time; no order
     - Denote: X,Y,B,R capital letter. a belongs to a 
   - **Subset**: is any set of elements of the given set , 
     - empty set belongs any set. 
     - natural numbers N = {1,2,3,4..}
     - integer numbers N = {0,1,2,3,4..}
     - rational numbers Q = { m/n| m ∈ Z, n ∈ N}. 
     - real numbers R = {a0, a1, a2, ..}
       - *SQRT(2) is not rational). n^2 = 2k As a result, m and n should be number can not be divided by any other numbers*
 3. **Mapping and Quantifiers**
    - **Mapping**:ordered realtionship between elements of X and Y. (two sets X and Y)/ The rules takes an element from X and tells the set of mapped elements from Y
    - Logic notation: "for all"; "exist"
         
4. **Suplement Material** 
- Axiomatic definition
  - x+y=y+x, x⋅y=y⋅x (it is easy: the commutative rule)
  - (x+y)+z=x+(y+z), (x⋅y)⋅z=x⋅(y⋅z) (associativity)
  - (x+y)⋅z=x⋅z+y⋅z (distributivity)
  - Existence of two neutral elements 1 and 0: a⋅1=a, a+0=a.
  - Existence of the inverse elements (except 0): a+(−a)=0, a⋅a−1=1
   - Non-triviality 0≠1
- the ability to compare two numbers.
  - For any two real numbers one is able to say a>b, a<b or a=b.
  - This order is transitive: if a<b, b<c, then a<c.
- completeness. ℝ=A∪B, A∩B=∅, such as any element a∈A is smaller than any element b∈B. Then there is a pivot real number c∈ℝ that a≤c≤ b a≤c≤b for any aa and bb elements from the corresponding sets.

5. **Functions**
- **Functions**: two sets X, Y. If and only it associates each element of the X set to **exactly one** elemenmt of the Y set. X: domian/set of arguments, Y: Codomain/set of values.
  - Ways to describle function: table of values; algebraic; Graphical 
  - **Function Graph**: a certain curve on the plane, (x, f(x)), x belongs to the function domain. 
- **Arithmetic and Compostition**
  - Elementary function: constant, exponential, logarithmic, powers, trigonometric ...
    - By applying arithmetic operation +, -, *, / can changefunctions domain and codomain, but keeps the rsult in calss of elementary functions. 
  - **Compostion**: The result of consequent application of functions f and g is called a composite function or composition. g(f(x)) *F:X->Y AND Y->Z; f:map(x)-> Y and g:map(Y)-> Z
  - **Graph Transformation**:
    - Some simple example transformation 
      - **Vertical shift**: y = f(x) -> f(x) + c
      - **Horizontal shift**: y = f(x) -> f(x+c)
      - **Vertical contraction**: y = f(x) -> y = c * f(x)
      - **Horizontal contraction**: y = f(x) -> y = f(c * x)
      - **Absolute varaible**: y = f(|x|)
      - **Absolute value**: y = |f(x)|
