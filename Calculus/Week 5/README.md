## Anti-derivative and Indefinite Integral: Definition and Calculation 
1. **Introduction** 
   - inverse operation to differentiation - integration 
   - Integral can be seen as continuous summation 
2. **Antiderivative: Definition**
   - **antiderivative**: F'(x) = f(x)
   - **indefinite integral**: antiderivatives of f(x): can be described as all possible vertical shift. integral f(x) = F(x) + c
3. **Antiderivative: Table of Integrals**
   - Table of integrals 
4. **Change of Variable and Integration by Parts**
   - replace high order variable with low 
     - Example: Intg x/(1+x^2)dx
   - Integral by part: Intg f' * g = f * g - intg f * g'dx
   - Example Intg arctag x dx 
5. **Antiderivative: Examples**
   - intg |x|dx = |x|* x /2 + c
   - intg 1/x dx = ln|x| + c, x > 0; = ln(-x) + c, x < 0
6. **Integrability in Elementary Functions**
   - **Integrable in elementary function**: if it's indefinite integral can be written by the fininite number of arithmetic operation and compositions of elementary function.
   - **Rational Fraction**: R(x) = P(x)/Q(x). p(x) and Q(x) are rational polynomials. 
     - Rational functions are always integrable
