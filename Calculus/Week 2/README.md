# Limits of Functions: definition, arithmetic, important limits 
1. **Introduction** 
   - Review: compute limits of sequences 
   - How does it change incase of real instead of natural domain 
   - How to compare function asymptotic point wise 
   - How does administering additional degree of freedom - second and other variable - affect limit 
2. **Real domain funcion**
   - What's the difference between domains of sequences and real valued functions
     - Limit is value resembles given sequence the most as the number n gets closer to infinity 
     - There is always a natural number in any neighborbood of the infinity, that's the only point with this quality 
     - Real:  set of point +/- infinity
3. **Function Limits**
   - Function Limits 
     - for all xn -> a the squence of values f(xn) -> C
4. **Function’s Limit: Examples** 
   - |f(x) - A| < eps 
   - lim x->0 sin(1/x) = not exist 
5. **Function’s Limit: Arithmetic** 
   - sum, difference, product, division(only true if all the limits exist)
6. **Function’s Limit: Indeterminate Forms and Boundary Rule** 
   - ax^n/bx^m
     - m > n, 0
     - m < n, inif
     - m = n, a/b
  - The boundary rule 
    - Bounded and infinitesimal function in turn is infinitesimal too 
 7. **Two Important Limits**
    - lim n->inf (1+n)^n = e; lim n->0 (1+x)^1/x = e;
    - lim x->0 sinx/x = 1
