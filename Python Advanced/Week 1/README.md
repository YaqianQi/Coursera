# Variable, reference, mutability 
1. Basic 
   - Python store objects in reference 
   - Immutable:
     - int, boolean, float, string, tuple
   - mutable:
     - list, set, dictionary
     - When the variable changed, it assigned other reference to the variable, it doens't change the original reference number
     - when you pass the value to other variable, you pass reference
     - If you want to modified value without affacting original value in mutable variables. 
     'import copy; copy.deepcopy();
